Along with the ability to star repls and tag repls, we now take repl organization one step further with the ability to search through your repls.

You can use the search function in your repls dashboard in a few ways:
* by keyword
* by title
* by tag
* by language

Please refer to the [search docs](/site/docs/repls-search) for detailed instructions on how to use it.
