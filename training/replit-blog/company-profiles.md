Today, we launch partnerships with 19 companies, offering 35+ templates for Replit users to build with. The goal? Helping our community build the next-generation of projects. Let me explain.

## Context: The growing strength of the Replit community

The Replit community is growing exponentially. As of today:
- +15M Replit users 
- +20M websites & apps created and hosted
- +10B monthly visits across websites & apps
- +2B Repls run 

In parallel, Replit as a platform has grown stronger. 
- Supports all programming languages.
- 80,000+ packages.
- Mobile app coming soon.
- State-of-the-art AI features.
- Ready-to-build templates.
- Replit Ventures.
  
Every month, Replit raises the ceiling on what devs can do. 

As a result, Replit users are building increasingly sophisticated projects. From learning their first line of code to building an app to [monetizing their creation](https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1506429498895470592?s=20&t=o_psEi7bsBSElw5QRDYkkg). Users are even landing jobs as professional developers from Replit.

## The next generation of developers

At Replit, we've always been about the future of software and bringing it to everyone, not just the lucky few in Silicon Valley. We feel strongly the next-generation of developers looks very different than the last. Globally distributed. Digital and cloud-native. Able to code and deploy from a $10 android phone.

Our user base and product reflect this future: 
* Over 80% of Replit users are based outside of the US
* Over 10% of Replit users code on mobile devices - not code for mobile, actually coding from a mobile device.
* Thriving community where people share code, collaborate, and have fun
* Idea to code to deployed apps in minutes not hours 

While we have a professional product, most of our users code for fun. 

To engage these developers, the old way - things like on-site hackathons in Sunnyvale where companies offer pizza  - won't work. Companies looking to find awesome new developers need to engage users where they are passionate. Replit is how to do that. Here's more on how.

### Live hosted examples
Ditch the static repository files. Host live templates for developers and potential customers to see the product in action immediately.

### Show them how to do it
Rather than explain your product, pull up a ready-to-go template anytime, anywhere. At a coffee shop? Run it on a mobile phone with Replit. At a conference? Send the url to the audience, so they can follow from their device. On a Zoom meeting? Send the Repl link in the chat.

### Multiplayer coding
Stop sending back-and-forth emails. Code together.

"Try adding ____ on line 1,947"
"There is a syntax error when you try to ____"
"Did you install ___ package? ___ library?"

No more. Jump into the users project with a join link and multiplayer code. For a live event, have users & customers jump into the code base with you. For async support, jump in & leave comments like a Google Doc. Spread the love. Leverage your valuable dev rel time how you do best.  

### User-led features
Engage directly with your user base. Source feedback on your product. See what they build!

## Building a Company Profile on Replit

Over the past few months, we have introduced:
- Followers 
- The following feed
- Community published templates

Now, companies have a central place where they can build a following of developers, host high-quality templates, and bolster their developer brand.

And today, we are introducing the "verified" badge for companies. We will be validating and verifying companies  and engagement for the Replit community.

If you work in the developer tools space and are interested in getting verified, apply [here](https://partnerships-form.util.repl.co/).

18 companies are already verified and you can build with them on Replit today.
