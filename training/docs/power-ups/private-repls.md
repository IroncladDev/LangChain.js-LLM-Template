# Private Repls

With a free Replit account, personal Repls are public by default.

As an individual, you can make your Repls private by purchasing a Hacker plan that come with unlimited private Repls or by activating the unlimited private Repls Power Up with Cycles from the [My Cycles page](https://replit.com/cycles).

Teams Pro accounts come with the ability to make any Team Repl private.

Private Repls can only be accessed by directly invited guests or by team members.

## Creating a private Repl

You can make a Repl private by toggling the Repl to Private when you're making a new Repl from a Template or forking an existing Repl.
