# Creating your first theme

With Custom Themes, you can make Replit truly yours by customizing much of the UI from the background and foreground colors site-wide to your code's syntax highlighting. Let's dive into creating your first theme and get Replit looking just the way you want it to!

Navigate to your [account page](https://replit.com/account) and scroll down to the **Themes** section Create a new theme, fill out the title, select a color scheme, optionally add a description, and hit **Create Theme**.

After creating your theme, you will be redirected to the Themes Editor. Let's first look at the **Global Theme** section and how each color option applies.

**Background** is the most noticeable color and the easiest one to get right. Notice how the entire page changes color as you edit it. Let's make it a very dark bluish color for this theme.

**Outline** controls the color of borders. I'll choose a nice dark blue color to give off that cyberpunk experience.

**Foreground** mostly controls text and icon colors. We're going to make the foreground a bluish-grey to give a lower contrast with the background, so as to not hurt the eyes through long coding sessions.

**Primary** controls the color of most buttons. Fitting with the other colors we've selected, a more cyan-teal blue should do.

**Positive** controls things like the color of the run button and those confirmation toasts that appear in the lower-right corner of the screen—anything that denotes something "positive". We've chosen a pale green color for this example theme.

**Negative** colors appear when there is an error or if you are about to perform a dangerous action. A nice orange color will do here.

Finally, hit **Apply Theme** to start using your new theme. If you want to go deeper and style syntax highlighting for your code, let's move on to the [next step](syntax-highlighting)
